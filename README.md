US Flight Data Analysis using Spark

Every year, the US airspace records roughly 15 million flights, as it is the most preferred and time saving mode of transport in the country, given the extent and terrain of the mainland. Usually, most of these flights originate or end at the major airports in the country, thus forming a cluster of hubs from which passengers take flights. Given the volume of flights and the popularity of the hubs, there are delays, or worse, even cancellations in some of the flights due to several reasons. 
In a quest to analyze these recordings of flights, we are aiming to identify the patterns in mobility and air traffic, that would eventually help us analyze and assess the reasons for delays and cancellations, and even predict them using popular ML techniques.
